# Hello, I'm Farhan <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72663882/171687151-bb31c996-c9d2-49c8-b593-734946893b23.gif" alt="waving hand gif" aria-hidden="true" width="30px" />

I'm passionate about Vue.js and fascinated by color-themed projects. As I continue my journey in frontend development, I'm keen on experimenting with creative ways to leverage colors and building interactive applications.

## Current Focus
- Learning and improving Vue.js skills.
- Developing color-centric projects that inspire creativity.

## Featured Projects
Here are a few projects Iâ€™ve been working on:
1. **[vCalc](https://github.com/MFM-347/vCalc)** - A lightweight calculator built with Vue.js.
2. **[ContraClarity](https://github.com/MFM-347/ContraClarity)** - A tool for visual contrast evaluation.
3. **[Vue Expense Tracker](https://github.com/MFM-347/Vue-Expense-Tracker)** - A simple, intuitive expense tracker.
